Since then, I have immersed myself in various programming languages, striving to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to tackle any task I've been given. From delving into the intricacies of Java and SQL to exploring the nuances of mobile and web development, I have embraced every opportunity to expand my technical repertoire. My passion for software development, databases and cybersecurity runs deep and whether in individual tasks or group work, I always strive to foster a hard-working, supportive and inclusive environment where everyone's ideas are valued. I believe we can make the world a better place, one semicolon at a time.|
