Whilst hibernate functions are handled in the services layer (this is meant to separate the database logic from the application). Another reason why joins provide better performance is because the database retrieves the data from multiple tables in a single query. This reduces the number of round trips between your application and the database. Whilst hibernate uses object-relational mapping (ORM), which often involves multiple SQL queries to fetch data from related tables. This often results in the N+1 problem, where multiple queries are executed to load related entities, resulting in slower performance.</p></li></ul><ol start="3"><li><h2 id="security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security"><span>Security</span></a></h2><p>3.1 User data should be securely stored and transmitted, with measures in place to prevent unauthorised access, data breaches, and malicious activities.<br> strategy :</p></li></ol><ul><li>Make use of token-based authorisation and use use role based security in the services</li><li>Making use of Role-based access control</li></ul><p>Implementation:</p><p>Automatic Scaling: Cloud Run automatically scales up and down based on the incoming traffic.
