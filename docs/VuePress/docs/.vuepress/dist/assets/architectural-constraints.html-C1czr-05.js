This setup is cost-effective and fits our immediate needs. However, as the data volume grows and the analytics requirements become more complex, we will need to scale.</p><pre><code>     1.2.1 In the future, we may implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to migrate data from Firebase Analytics to a more scalable solution like Google BigQuery or AWS Redshift, allowing for larger datasets and more advanced queries.
     1.2.2 If real-time data analysis becomes a priority, tools such as Google Cloud Dataflow could be integrated to manage and analyse real-time data streams.
     1.2.3 It&#39;s important to note that Firebase Analytics has limitations, such as hit limits per month and complexity in generating custom reports.
