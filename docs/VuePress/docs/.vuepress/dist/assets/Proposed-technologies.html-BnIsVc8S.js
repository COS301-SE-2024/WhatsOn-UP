</code></pre><ul><li>Trello: Simple and visual Kanban board system for task management and progress tracking. <ul><li>GitHub Boards: Integrated with Git repositories, offering basic Kanban functionality within the familiar GitHub environment.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Benefits for WhatsOn@UP: Trello or GitHub Boards provide a flexible approach for task management and team communication, allowing us to adapt to our preferred workflow.</p><p><strong>Testing: JUnit</strong></p><p>Reasoning: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java with the following benefits:</p><ul><li>Robust Framework: Offers a comprehensive set of annotations and assertions for writing and running repeatable tests. <ul><li><p>Integration: Seamlessly integrates with build tools like Maven and Gradle, as well as CI/CD pipelines.</p></li><li><p>Extensibility: Supports extension frameworks such as JUnit 5 extensions for custom behaviours.</p></li><li><p>Community Support: Large community and extensive documentation, providing a wealth of resources and plugins.</p></li><li><p>Fast: Provides fast test execution for rapid feedback during development.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Benefits for WhatsOn@UP: JUnit helps us ensure the reliability and correctness of our backend services written in Kotlin. By writing unit tests and integration tests, we can validate the functionality of individual components and their interactions, catching bugs early in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>Testing: Flutter’s Built-in Testing Library</strong></p><p>Reasoning: JFlutter’s built-in testing library offers a suite of testing tools designed specifically for Flutter applications:</p><ul><li>Unit Testing: Allows testing of individual components (functions, methods, classes) to ensure they work as expected. <ul><li>Integration Testing: Provides tools to test the complete app or large parts of it, verifying that all pieces work together.</li><li>Widget Testing: Enables testing of Flutter widgets, ensuring the UI behaves correctly.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Benefits for WhatsOn@UP: Flutter’s built-in testing library helps us maintain high code quality for the mobile app. By leveraging unit, widget, and integration tests, we can ensure the app&#39;s functionality, UI/UX, and performance meet the expected standards, leading to a smooth and reliable user experience.</p><p><strong>Documentation: Google Docs and Markdown</strong></p><p>Reasoning: Choosing the right documentation tool depends on the type and complexity of information:</p><ul><li>Google Docs: Ideal for collaborative creation and editing of project documentation.Offers clear formatting options and ease of use for various documentation types (user guides, design documents).</li><li>Markdown: Well-suited for simpler documentation like code comments, API references, or short READMEs. Lightweight and integrates easily with code repositories like GitHub.</li></ul><p>Benefits for WhatsOn@UP: This combination allows us to leverage the strengths of both tools. Google Docs facilitates collaborative creation of comprehensive documentation, while Markdown can be used for concise code-related documentation or READMEs within the project repository.</p><p><strong>CI/CD: GitHub Actions and AWS CodeDeploy</strong></p><pre><code>   Reasoning: Automating builds, testing, and deployments streamlines development:
</code></pre><p>GitHub Actions: Free built-in CI/CD workflows within GitHub repositories. Ideal for simpler deployments and triggering automated tests upon code pushes.</p><p>AWS CodeDeploy: Service for automating deployments to servers or containers on AWS. Integrates well with other AWS services for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Benefits for WhatsOn@UP: This combination provides a cost-effective and scalable approach to CI/CD. We can utilise GitHub Actions for initial automation and graduate to AWS CodeDeploy for more complex deployments as the project matures.</p>`,47)]))}const d=t(a,[["render",s],["__file","Proposed-technologies.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/documentation/srs/Proposed-technologies.html","title":"Technology choices","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"","slug":"-2","link":"#-2","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1727544814000,"contributors":[{"name":"zdanise","email":"zetdanise89@gmail.com","commits":3}]},"filePathRelative":"documentation/srs/Proposed-technologies.md"}');export{d as comp,c as data};
