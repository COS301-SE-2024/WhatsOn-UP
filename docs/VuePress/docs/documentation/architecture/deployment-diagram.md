## Introduction of Project

Students often miss out on enriching experiences beyond academics due to the difficulty in finding and managing various campus events. Current methods rely on scattered sources, making it challenging for students and even university guests to stay informed and involved. The proposed WhatsOn@UP software system aims to be the central hub for all events happening at the University of Pretoria, with the vision of expanding to encompass other universities at a later stage.

Imagine a centralised hub where all university events are readily discoverable. Students and guests can effortlessly browse public events or search for specific interests using clear filters. Need to navigate to an event? A built-in map ensures you remain on course. Adding events to your personal calendar? Just a single tap keeps you organised. The aim is to design an intuitive and user-friendly application that puts all the information users need at their fingertips.

Behind the scenes, our developers will not only prioritise a user-friendly experience but also ensure robust security measures are built in to safeguard the university's integrity and reputation. We, as DevForce, are invested in the initiative to revolutionise the way students engage with their university communities.
