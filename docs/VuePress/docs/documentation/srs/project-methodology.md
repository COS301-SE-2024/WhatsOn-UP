# **Project Development Methodology**

Our team will be using the Agile Process which focuses primarily on the implementation of the system, where just enough, digestible documentation is provided to keep all stakeholders on the same page. This process will be used alongside the Scrum Methodology in order to deliver customer value, remain flexible to any changes, and maintain transparency with stakeholders.

As such, the development process will be broken up into 2-week sprints where a minimum viable product will be produced. In these two weeks, we will have short daily stand-up meetings (daily Scrums) to report progress and voice any concerns in order to ensure consistent progress. Before such a sprint, tasks will be taken from the Product Backlog (produced from the MVP being broken up into features) based on story points assigned to such tasks \- as opposed to using fixed time-block estimation. 

During a given sprint, backlog refinement will be performed to ensure that features wanted by the customer and needed by the client are efficiently prioritised. This will be done to help organize and plan upcoming sprints. 

After each 2-week period, there will be a Sprint Retrospection where what worked, what did not work, and what should be changed for future sprints will all be evaluated.
