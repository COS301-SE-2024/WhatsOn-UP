Using modern mobile application technology, WhatsOn@UP aims to revolutionise the way students and guests interact with university events. By creating a centralised, secure, and user-friendly platform, the project seeks to enhance campus life and build a stronger university community. The scope of WhatsOn@UP includes developing a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, with a backend implemented in Spring Boot (using Kotlin), NestJS  and a PostgreSQL database. The system will be hosted on  AWS to ensure scalability and reliability.
