### **Service Contracts**


### **Architectural Patterns**

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**

WhatsOn@UP is expected to handle various functionalities like event search, user management, and push notifications. SOA allows us to decompose the application into independent, reusable services. This approach offers:

- Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on their needs. For example, the event search service can be scaled up during peak usage times without impacting other services like user management.
- Security: Fine-grained access controls can be implemented at the service level, ensuring only authorised users or applications can access specific functionalities. This enhances security by limiting access points to sensitive data.
- Interoperability: Services can be designed with standardised APIs that can be accessed by different technologies and platforms. This allows for easier integration with other systems.
1. **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB):**

To ensure reliable and secure communication as the number of services in WhatsOn@UP grows, an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) acts as a central hub, facilitating data exchange between services. This ESB implementation offers several key benefits:

- Scalability: The ESB efficiently routes messages even when services are spread across multiple servers, ensuring WhatsOn@UP functions smoothly.
- Security: The ESB enforces security measures like message encryption and authentication to protect data exchanged between services.
- Performance: The ESB manages asynchronous communication between services, improving user interface responsiveness by not blocking the UI while services retrieve data from each other.

**3. Model-View-Controller (MVC):**

MVC is a well-established pattern that separates the application logic (Model) from the user interface (View) and the data binding between them (Controller). This separation promotes:

- Usability: Developers can focus on building a robust model and efficient data handling, leading to a more maintainable and user-friendly application in the long run.
- Performance: MVC allows for optimised UI rendering and data handling techniques, contributing to better overall application performance.

By implementing these architecture patterns, WhatsOn@UP can achieve the desired level of scalability, security, usability, and performance.

### **Project Development Methodology**

Our team will be using the Agile Process which focuses primarily on the implementation of the system, where just enough, digestible documentation is provided to keep all stakeholders on the same page. This process will be used alongside the Scrum Methodology in order to deliver customer value, remain flexible to any changes, and maintain transparency with stakeholders.

As such, the development process will be broken up into 2-week sprints where a minimum viable product will be produced. In these two weeks, we will have short daily stand-up meetings (daily Scrums) to report progress and voice any concerns in order to ensure consistent progress. Before such a sprint, tasks will be taken from the Product Backlog (produced from the MVP being broken up into features) based on story points assigned to such tasks - as opposed to using fixed time-block estimation.

During a given sprint, backlog refinement will be performed to ensure that features wanted by the customer and needed by the client are efficiently prioritised. This will be done to help organise and plan upcoming sprints.

After each 2-week period, there will be a Sprint Retrospection where what worked, what did not work, and what should be changed for future sprints will all be evaluated.

# Proactive Planning:Addressing Key Considerations for WhatsOn@UP Development

1. **Prioritizing User Experience (UX):**

Creating an intuitive and user-friendly experience is paramount for WhatsOn@UP's success.  To achieve this, we plan to conduct usability testing sessions throughout the development process.  These sessions, involving students on campus, will allow us to identify and address any usability issues early on.  Furthermore, we'll integrate in-app tutorials to guide new users through the app's functionalities.  We'll also adopt an iterative design process, where user feedback from testing sessions is actively incorporated to continuously improve the overall UX.  Additionally, we will explore A/B testing different design elements and functionalities to see which ones resonate best with users.

1. **Enabling Offline Functionality:**

We understand the importance of ensuring the app functions even when users are offline.  To address this challenge, we plan to implement caching mechanisms. This will allow the app to store frequently accessed event data, such as upcoming events or saved favorites, for offline use.  Even when offline, users will still be able to browse saved events, view details of previously accessed events, or utilize basic filtering options.

1. **Guaranteeing Security:**

Security is a top priority for WhatsOn@UP.  We plan to address this by utilizing secure data storage solutions, including encrypted databases and user authentication mechanisms.  Furthermore, we'll follow secure coding best practices to minimize vulnerabilities and stay updated on the latest security threats.  To proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses, we will also consider conducting penetration testing during development.

## Augmented Reality
Augmented reality (AR) navigation is a new technology that helps people find their way by showing directions on their device's screen, like a smartphone or a headset. It combines real-time location data with virtual information to make navigation easier and more intuitive. Instead of having to look at a map and compare it to the real world, AR navigation overlays directions directly onto what you see through your device's camera.
Here's how indoor AR navigation works in three simple steps:

- Finding Your Location: First, the system figures out where you are inside the building. This is the hardest part.
Planning the Route: Next, it creates a path from where you are (point A) to where you want to go (point B).
- Displaying Directions: Finally, it shows virtual directions on your screen, on top of the real-world view.
The last two steps are quite straightforward. The real challenge is accurately finding your current location inside the building. 

## Unity MARS 
Unity MARS (Mixed and Augmented Reality Studio) is a powerful tool that enhances the development of augmented reality (AR) applications by providing an intuitive, robust framework for creating context-aware AR experiences. Here’s how Unity MARS can help with AR navigation:

Unity MARS allows developers to create AR applications that understand and interact with the real world in a contextual manner. For AR navigation, this means the application can accurately interpret the environment, identify landmarks, and provide relevant navigational cues based on the user's surroundings.

Unity MARS includes tools for precise environment mapping, which is crucial for AR navigation. It can create detailed spatial maps of the environment, allowing for accurate placement of navigation markers and routes. This ensures that virtual navigation aids align perfectly with the physical world.

Unity MARS supports geolocation and anchoring, allowing navigation applications to use GPS data and anchor virtual objects to specific physical locations. This feature is critical for outdoor navigation, enabling users to follow routes and find destinations accurately.

Unity MARS provides a scalable framework that can handle various levels of complexity in AR navigation projects. Whether it’s a simple indoor navigation system for a museum or a comprehensive city-wide navigation app, Unity MARS can be customized to meet specific project requirements.
